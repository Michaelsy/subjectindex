Subject Index plugin for Dokuwiki:
====================
"Structured hierarchical tagging": Create subject index entries "anywhere" in your wiki pages, that will then be compiled into a Subject Index page, listed A-Z, by headings, then entries/links. I personally find that this well replaces tagging... and generates a much more useful, readable index at the end, when compared with "tag-clouds".
